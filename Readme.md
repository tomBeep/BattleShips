Tom's BattleShips game

First game I've created using my own GUI made with Swing. Run by launching from the main class, when I've finished everything I'd like to I'll make a jar file for easy download/launching. 

Based off the classic game of battleships. There is a rules document inside the game that I wrote. But if you want more info see the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)
