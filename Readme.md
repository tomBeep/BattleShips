Tom's BattleShips game.


Created entirely by me! First game I've created using my own GUI with Swing.
Is designed to be played by two players using a single computer.

Run by downloading the jar file and double clicking it.

Based off the classic game of battleships. There is a rules document inside the game that I wrote. But if you want more info see the wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)
